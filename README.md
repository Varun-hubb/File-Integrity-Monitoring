# File-Integrity-Monitoring
This project demonstrates the implementation of File Integrity Monitoring using Wazuh SIEM to detect unauthorized file changes in real time.  The system monitors critical directories and generates alerts for file creation, modification, and deletion.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to implement and demonstrate File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) using Wazuh SIEM to detect, log, and analyze unauthorized changes to critical files and system configurations on a Windows system, enabling improved security monitoring and incident response.
